## Background
Fossil Grove is a unique earth heritage site with 330 million years old fossil tree stumps. Due to its geological importance, the site is used to teach University students and keen visitors. As such, educational content were designed and implemented for adult learners.

## Problem Statement
We were tasked to create an interactive and educational experience for 10 year olds from Scotstoun Primary to enjoy during their 1.5 hour trip to Fossil Grove. We came up with Grove Quest, an interactive game with "Amazing Race"/Scavenger Hunt-inspired challenges! More info in our portfolio site.
