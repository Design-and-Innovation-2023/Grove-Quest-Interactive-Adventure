# Requirements Gathering

The team conducted two phases of requirements gathering. Initially, they posed their inquiries via email to both Scotstoun Primary and Fossil Grove, followed by an on-site visit to Fossil Grove for further investigation.


## Sending the email

The team sent an email aiming to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the project needs, and to confirm the alignment of the team's conceptual framework with that of the client's.


### Goals 

- Gain knowledge about any previous student-engagement initiatives held by Fossil Grove.
- Discover potential challenges faced when engaging students with Fossil Grove.
- Comprehend the anticipated learning outcomes for primary school students.
- Develop an understanding of the students' requirements.
- Ascertain what tools and technologies are accessible for utilization.


### Findings

- Previously conducted a session for a small group of primary school students, finding that engaging a larger group for two hours may pose a challenge.
- Conducted monthly earth science activities geared towards primary school-aged children, but this necessitates considerable volunteer time.
- Organized field excursions for first-year earth science students from Glasgow University, utilizing a three-station model with a teacher at each, rotating students every 30 minutes followed by a group review.
- In addition to geology, aims to highlight connections to Glasgow's industrial heritage, climate change, evolution, and heritage conservation, thereby emphasizing the significance of geology as a future career and fostering appreciation for the nearby historical facility.
- Anticipates class sizes of 29-33, suggesting that smaller groups of about 5-6 students would be more manageable.
- Notes that primary school students exhibit a range of ability levels, with some having a reading age of 6-7 while others are at 11-12.
- Reports that iPads are available for use, but usage is limited by restrictions on accessible content.


## Visiting Fossil Grove

The team visited Fossil Grove to engage in-person discussions with the clients and to partcipate in a guided tour of Fossil Grove.

### Goals 

- Identify suitable venues for conducting activities planned.
- Pinpoint the educational significance of the locations.
- Discover any limitations present at the site.


### Findings

- Identified four primary areas of interest for visits: the main museum, the back of the museum, front region, and quarry.
- Pinpointed essential educational material in each area to enhance activity development.
- One teacher would be assigned to each student group of 6-7.
- Every student would have access to an iPad.
- No WiFi connectivity available at the venue.
- Provision for students requiring extra support due to physical or mental disabilities.
- No guided tours, students are expected to explore independently.
