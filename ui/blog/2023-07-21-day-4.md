Class:
Today, we delved into the concept of prototyping. We drew our prototype idea on paper to visualize our plan better. It was a productive exercise as it helped us refine our concept. Additionally, we shared our prototype idea with the Curio Robot team, providing us with an opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions.

Project:
We had a discussion with Professor Grizou concerning the email on our choice of backend/database implementation. These conversations are crucial in making informed decisions about the technology stack we use.

We also recorded our Week 1 pitch video to summarize our progress and to share our future plans. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogf-5Qy81s&ab_channel=dthx2710).

Moving forward, we held discussions about our plans, focusing on refining our prototype and ensuring our technology decisions align with our project goals.
